## Instructions

### Pull and Run

Navigate to the directory that contains this `README.md` file, then follow the steps below. Note that I do not use the normal `--network host` option but the `-p 5432:5432` option. For some reason bridge mode leads to "connection refused" errors. Also, make sure to specifcy your own location for `HOST_PGDATA`. The path specified in `HOST_PGDATA` is where your data will be stored and allows you to persist your DB even when Docker is turned off.

	# Pull the image
	docker pull ryanzotti/vehicle:latest
		
	# Make sure the docker network exists, otherwise create it
	docker network ls
	docker network create car_network

	# Run the image
	docker run -i -t -p 8887:8887 \
	  --name control-loop \
	  --network car_network \
	  --privileged \
	  ryanzotti/vehicle:latest \
	  python3 /root/car/start.py

	# Interactively running the container also requires the network
	docker run -it --network car_network --privileged  ryanzotti/vehicle:latest /bin/bash

	# Stop the image
	docker rm -f control-loop


### Build

Ensure that the base image is available (this is a note for Ryan). Many of the part servers build on top of this base image.

	docker build -t ryanzotti/vehicle-server:latest .
	docker push ryanzotti/vehicle-server:latest

You only need to follow the steps below once. Note: only Ryan has access to modify the image hosted under his DockerHub namespace, so the `push` command will fail for everyone else. The `pull` command should be allowed, however.

	# Build the laptop image
	docker build -t ryanzotti/vehicle:latest .
	
	# Save changes to DockerHub
	docker push ryanzotti/vehicle:latest
